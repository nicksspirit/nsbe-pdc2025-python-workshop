    "# Chapter 1: Designing the AI Agent's Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of AI agents and tool-based problem solving\n",
    "- Build specialized functions that an AI agent can use\n",
    "- Create a resume skill extraction tool using PydanticAI\n",
    "- Develop a job matching algorithm with scoring\n",
    "- Learn best practices for designing AI agent tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to AI Agents and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor Cue:** Start with the big picture: \"We're building the final piece of our workshop - an AI agent that can read a resume and find the best matching job. Ask the audience: What would such a system need to do?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An AI agent is a system that can autonomously perform tasks by using available tools. Think of it like a smart assistant that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand** what you're asking for\n",
    "- **Choose** the right tools for the job\n",
    "- **Execute** those tools in the correct sequence\n",
    "- **Combine** results to give you a final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Goal: Resume-to-Job Matching Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're building an agent that solves this problem:\n",
    "1. **Input**: A resume (as text)\n",
    "2. **Process**: Extract skills and match against job database\n",
    "3. **Output**: The best matching job opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor Cue:** Draw this on a whiteboard or screen: Resume → Extract Skills → Score Jobs → Best Match. This visual helps students understand the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking Down the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this complex problem, we'll create two specialized tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Skill Extraction Tool**: Reads resume text and identifies key technical skills\n",
    "2. **Job Matching Tool**: Compares skills against job postings and calculates match scores\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor Cue:** Emphasize that breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable functions is a fundamental programming principle. Each tool has a single, clear responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Our Tools Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Required Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start coding, let's make sure we have all the necessary packages installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor Cue:** Have everyone run these installation commands first. Explain that we're using Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Flash model which is free and has generous usage limits. We use `uv` for fast package management."
