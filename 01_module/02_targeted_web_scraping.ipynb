    "# Chapter 2: Targeted Web Scraping with Playwright\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Set up and configure Playwright for automated web scraping\n",
    "- Navigate job search websites programmatically\n",
    "- Extract structured data from dynamic web pages\n",
    "- Handle common web scraping challenges (rate limiting, dynamic content)\n",
    "- Save scraped data in a format suitable for machine learning analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Web Scraping Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor Cue:** Begin by pulling up Indeed.com in your browser. Perform a manual search for \"Data Scientists\" in Oregon to show the class what we're trying to automate. Point out the various elements we want to extract and discuss the challenges of manual data collection at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our exploratory data analysis, we identified high-value target occupations in specific states. While the BLS OEWS data provides excellent foundational insights, it lacks the granular, real-time information that current job postings offer, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specific skill requirements\n",
    "- Company details and culture information  \n",
    "- Exact salary ranges and benefits\n",
    "- Remote work options\n",
    "- Educational requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Playwright Over Other Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor Cue:** Ask the audience: \"Has anyone used BeautifulSoup or Selenium before? What challenges did you encounter?\" Use their responses to highlight Playwright's advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright offers several advantages for modern web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast and Reliable**: Built for modern web applications\n",
    "2. **Handles JavaScript**: Executes dynamic content automatically\n",
    "3. **Multiple Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, and Safari\n",
    "4. **Built-in Waiting**: Intelligent waiting for elements to load\n",
    "5. **Robust Error Handling**: Better handling of network issues and timeouts\n",
