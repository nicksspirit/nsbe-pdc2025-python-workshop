    "**Technical Skills:**\n",
    "- âœ… **AI Job Matching** - Created intelligent job title mapping using PydanticAI\n",
    "- âœ… **Complex Data Handling** - Processed variations and edge cases automatically\n",
    "- âœ… **Confidence Scoring** - Built in quality assessment with AI confidence ratings\n",
    "- âœ… **Batch Processing** - Applied AI functions efficiently to real datasets\n",
    "- âœ… **Code Organization** - Extended our janitor module with reusable functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- AI excels at fuzzy matching and handling variations\n",
    "- Confidence scores help identify uncertain matches for review\n",
    "- Structured outputs make AI integration reliable and predictable\n",
    "- Building reusable functions accelerates future development\n",

    "### Preview: Chapter 3 Data Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 3, we will:\n",
    "- Create a location matching function to complete our data integration\n",
    "- Use all our janitor functions together to clean our Indeed data\n",
    "- Merge Indeed and OEWS datasets for the first time\n",
    "- Save our final clean dataset for the afternoon dashboard module\n",
