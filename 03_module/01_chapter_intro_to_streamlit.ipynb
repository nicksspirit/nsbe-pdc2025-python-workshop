    "# Chapter 1: Introduction to Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what Streamlit is and why it's perfect for rapid prototyping\n",
    "- Create your first Streamlit app with basic components\n",
    "- Learn the fundamental Streamlit execution model\n",
    "- Run a Streamlit app from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Streamlit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is a Python framework that transforms your scripts into interactive web applications with minimal effort. Unlike traditional web frameworks that require HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, Streamlit lets you build apps using pure Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tagline says it all: \"The fastest way to build and share data apps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles of Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scripts run from top to bottom** - Every time a user interacts with your app, the entire script reruns\n",
    "2. **Widgets are simple Python function calls** - No complex state management required\n",
    "3. **Data flows automatically** - Changes in widgets automatically trigger app updates\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplicity is both Streamlit's strength and something to be mindful of when building larger applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your First Streamlit App\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple \"Hello World\" application to understand the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file called `hello_world_app.py` in the `03_module/app` directory and add the following code:"

    "\n",
    "Follow these guidelines as you build Streamlit applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep it simple** - Start with basic components and add complexity gradually\n",
    "2. **Use descriptive labels** - Make your app self-explanatory\n",
    "3. **Provide feedback** - Use `st.success()`, `st.error()`, `st.warning()` for user feedback\n",
    "4. **Think about performance** - Use `@st.cache_data` for expensive operations\n",
    "5. **Test interactively** - The browser automatically refreshes as you save changes\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learner Challenge 2**: Create a simple calculator app that uses Streamlit components. Include:\n",
    "> - Two number inputs for the operands\n",
    "> - A selectbox for choosing the operation (+, -, *, /)\n",
    "> - Display the result using `st.success()` for positive results and `st.info()` for negative results\n",
    "> - Use columns to organize the layout nicely\n",
    "> - Add error handling for division by zero using `st.error()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**App won't start:**\n",
    "- Check that you're in the correct directory\n",
    "- Ensure Streamlit is installed: `uv add streamlit`\n",
    "- Try a different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Browser doesn't open automatically:**\n",
    "- Manually navigate to `http://localhost:8501`\n",
    "- Check firewall settings\n",
    "- Try `--server.headless false` flag\n",
    "\n",
    "**App keeps refreshing:**\n",
    "- This is normal behavior - Streamlit reruns the script on every interaction\n",
    "- Use session state for persistent data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Streamlit transforms Python scripts into web apps with minimal code\n",
    "- The script reruns completely on every user interaction\n",
    "- Use `st.session_state` to maintain data between reruns\n",
    "- Layout components help organize your app professionally\n",
    "- Streamlit apps are perfect for rapid prototyping and sharing data insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we'll use these Streamlit fundamentals to build an interactive dashboard using the job data we cleaned and processed in Module 2. We'll create visualizations, add interactivity, and even generate PDF reports!\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take all that job data we worked with earlier and turn it into a beautiful, interactive dashboard that your colleagues could actually use!"
